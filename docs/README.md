# Tic Tac Toe
![alt-text](/public/tic-tac-toe-image.png "Tic-Tac-Toe")

I've created a simple game of tic-tac-toe using TypeScript and React
## Features
- **TypeScript & React:** Utilizes TypeScript’s type checking for more robust code, paired with React’s modular structure.
- **Game Logic:** Straightforward win-check mechanism and easy-to-read code structure.
- **Responsive UI:** Works seamlessly on different screen sizes.

## Getting Started
1. `git clone git@github.com/Niricha/Tic-Tac-Toe.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run watch` and check that it worked
4. `open public/index.html` and make sure the browser renders the image above
5. `git remote remove origin`
